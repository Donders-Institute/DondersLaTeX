This is a repository with a LaTeX stylesheet for the Donders Institute and contains a suggestion for a file structure. It is not meant to be an official template, but rather a suggestion for if you dare take up the challenge of LaTeX for writing your scientific papers.

The folder structure is as follows
-Bibliography
--Bibliography.bib
-StyleSheets
--DondersInstitute
---[contents]
--elsarticle
---[contents]
-Papers
--ExamplePaper
---Example_Donders.tex
---Example_Elsevier.tex

This structure easily facilitates multiple papers that refer to the same bibliography and stylesheets. LaTeX automatically imports only the references from your bibliography file that you're '\cite'ing in your TeX-file.
Note that the two examples are almost identical and use the same source files, and just use a different style sheet. This generates a paper in the format of a different journal.
