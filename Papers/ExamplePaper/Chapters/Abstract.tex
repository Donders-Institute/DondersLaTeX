\begin{abstract}
This is a style sheet of a paper with highly sophisticated text, related to the scientific nature of pink elephants. Although pink elephants were recently thought to be extinct, this article proves that dodos never even existed. Therefore, since correlation does not imply causation, this statement is claimed to be false. The author cannot be held responsible for any damage this may cause to the trees in the rainforest of the Amazone.
